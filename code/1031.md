Given any string of N (>=5) characters, you are asked to form the characters into the shape of U. For example, "helloworld" can be printed as:

h　　d
e　　l
l　　r
lowo

That is, the characters must be printed in the original order, starting top-down from the left vertical line with n1 characters, then left to right along the bottom line with n2 characters, and finally bottom-up along the vertical line with n3 characters. And more, we would like U to be as squared as possible -- that is, it must be satisfied that n1 = n3 = max { k| k <= n2 for all 3 <= n2 <= N } with n1 + n2 + n3 - 2 = N.
#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains one string with no less than 5 and no more than 80 characters in a line. The string contains no white space.

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the input string in the shape of U as specified in the description.

#### Sample Input:
helloworld!
#### Sample Output:
h　　!
e　　d
l　　l
lowor

**题目要求：**将给出的一句话按u型输出，并且形状尽可能接近于正方形。

**思路：**由n1 = n3 = max { k| k <= n2 for all 3 <= n2 <= N }以及n1 + n2 + n3 - 2 = N可以得出n1=(N+2)/3，那么就有n2=N+2-2*n1。接下来按要求输出即可。注意要处理好输出时的边界问题

```
#include<cstdio>
#include<cstring>
int main()
{
    char a[81];
    int len,n1,n2,i,j;

    scanf("%s",a);
    len=strlen(a);
    n1=(len+2)/3;
    n2=len+2-2*n1;
    for(i=0;i<n1-1;i++){    //输出前n1-1行
        printf("%c",a[i]);
        for(j=0;j<n2-2;j++) //输出n2-2个空格
            printf(" ");
        printf("%c\n",a[len-i-1]);
    }
    a[n1+n2-1]='\0';    //输出最后一行
    printf("%s\n",a+n1-1);
    return 0;
}
```
