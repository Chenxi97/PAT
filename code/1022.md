A Digital Library contains millions of books, stored according to their titles, authors, key words of their abstracts, publishers, and published years. Each book is assigned an unique 7-digit number as its ID. Given any query from a reader, you are supposed to output the resulting books, sorted in increasing order of their ID's.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains a positive integer N (<=10000) which is the total number of books. Then N blocks follow, each contains the information of a book in 6 lines:

Line #1: the 7-digit ID number;
Line #2: the book title -- a string of no more than 80 characters;
Line #3: the author -- a string of no more than 80 characters;
Line #4: the key words -- each word is a string of no more than 10 characters without any white space, and the keywords are separated by exactly one space;
Line #5: the publisher -- a string of no more than 80 characters;
Line #6: the published year -- a 4-digit number which is in the range [1000, 3000].
It is assumed that each book belongs to one author only, and contains no more than 5 key words; there are no more than 1000 distinct key words in total; and there are no more than 1000 distinct publishers.

After the book information, there is a line containing a positive integer M (<=1000) which is the number of user's search queries. Then M lines follow, each in one of the formats shown below:

1: a book title
2: name of an author
3: a key word
4: name of a publisher
5: a 4-digit number representing the year
#### Output Specification:

For each query, first print the original query in a line, then output the resulting book ID's in increasing order, each occupying a line. If no book is found, print "Not Found" instead.

**思路：**定义5个map<string,vecto<int>>变量存储书籍信息和id的对应关系。不过这道题只用一个map存储所有对应关系也能通过。

```
#include<iostream>
#include<map>
#include<vector>
#include<string>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int bid,n,m,i;
    map<string,vector<int> > book;	//偷懒只用了一个map
    string ti,au,pub,keyword,year;
    cin>>n;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++){
        scanf("%d\n",&bid);
        getline(cin,ti);    //读取书名
        book[ti].push_back(bid);
        getline(cin,au);    //读取作者
        book[au].push_back(bid);
        while(cin>>keyword){    //读取关键词
            book[keyword].push_back(bid);
            char c=getchar();
            if(c=='\n') break;
        }
        getline(cin,pub);   //读取出版社
        book[pub].push_back(bid);
        getline(cin,year);  //读取年份
        book[year].push_back(bid);
    }
    string q;
    int type;
    scanf("%d\n",&m);
    for(i=0;i<m;i++){
        scanf("%d: ",&type);
        getline(cin,q);
        printf("%d: %s\n",type,q.c_str());
        if(book[q].size()==0){
            printf("Not Found\n");
            continue;
        }
        sort(book[q].begin(),book[q].end());    //按大小排序
        for(int j=0;j<book[q].size();j++)
            printf("%07d\n",book[q][j]);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
