Given two strings S1 and S2, S = S1 - S2 is defined to be the remaining string after taking all the characters in S2 from S1. Your task is simply to calculate S1 - S2 for any given strings. However, it might not be that simple to do it fast.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case consists of two lines which gives S1 and S2, respectively. The string lengths of both strings are no more than 104. It is guaranteed that all the characters are visible ASCII codes and white space, and a new line character signals the end of a string.

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, print S1 - S2 in one line.

#### Sample Input:
They are students.
aeiou
#### Sample Output:
Thy r stdnts.

**题目要求：**给出两个字符串，将第一个字符串中所有在第二个字符串中出现过的字符删除，输出第一个字符串。

**思路：**建立一个数组asc[256],初始值为零。凡是在第二个数组中出现过的字符，将其值设为1。然后输出第一个字符串中asc[i]为0的字符。

```
#include<cstdio>
#include<cstring>
int main()
{
    int i,lena,lenb,asc[256]={0};
    char a[10010],b[10010];

    fgets(a,10010,stdin);
    fgets(b,10010,stdin);
    lena=strlen(a);
    lenb=strlen(b);
    for(i=0;i<lenb;i++)
        asc[b[i]]=1;
    for(i=0;i<lena;i++)
        if(asc[a[i]]==0)
            printf("%c",a[i]);
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```
