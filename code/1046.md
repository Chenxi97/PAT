The task is really simple: given N exits on a highway which forms a simple cycle, you are supposed to tell the shortest distance between any pair of exits.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains an integer N (in [3, 105]), followed by N integer distances D1 D2 ... DN, where Di is the distance between the i-th and the (i+1)-st exits, and DN is between the N-th and the 1st exits. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space. The second line gives a positive integer M (<=104), with M lines follow, each contains a pair of exit numbers, provided that the exits are numbered from 1 to N. It is guaranteed that the total round trip distance is no more than 107.

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, print your results in M lines, each contains the shortest distance between the corresponding given pair of exits.

#### Sample Input:
5 1 2 4 14 9
3
1 3
2 5
4 1
#### Sample Output:

**题目要求：**求一个无向环中两点之间的最短距离

**思路：**为了减少不必要的重复计算，避免超时，用d[i]保存每一点到第一个点的距离，total 为整个环的长度。当st&lt;ed时,两点之间的最短距离为 min(total-sum,sum)。要注意的一点是输入数据中可能会有 st&gt;ed ,此时要交换两个数。
```
#include<cstdio>
#include<algorithm>
#define MAX 100010
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n,k,dis,d[MAX]={0},total=0;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
        scanf("%d",&dis);
        total+=dis;
        d[i+1]=total;//每一点到第一点的距离
    }
    int st,ed;
    scanf("%d",&k);
    for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
        scanf("%d%d",&st,&ed);
        if(st>ed) swap(st,ed);//交换两点
        int sum=d[ed]-d[st];//求最短距离
        printf("%d\n",min(total-sum,sum));
    }
    return 0;
}
```
