Given a sequence of positive numbers, a segment is defined to be a consecutive subsequence. For example, given the sequence {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}, we have 10 segments: (0.1) (0.1, 0.2) (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) (0.2) (0.2, 0.3) (0.2, 0.3, 0.4) (0.3) (0.3, 0.4) (0.4).

Now given a sequence, you are supposed to find the sum of all the numbers in all the segments. For the previous example, the sum of all the 10 segments is 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.6 + 1.0 + 0.2 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 0.3 + 0.7 + 0.4 = 5.0.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N, the size of the sequence which is no more than 105. The next line contains N positive numbers in the sequence, each no more than 1.0, separated by a space.

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the sum of all the numbers in all the segments, accurate up to 2 decimal places.

#### Sample Input:
4
0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 
#### Sample Output:
5.00

**思路：**包含元素i的序列的个数等于i左边元素的个数乘以i右边元素的个数。

```
#include<cstdio>
int main()
{
    int n,i;
    double a,sum=0.0;

    scanf("%d",&n);
    for(i=1;i<=n;i++){
        scanf("%lf",&a);
        sum+=a*i*(n-i+1);
    }
    printf("%.2lf\n",sum);
    return 0;
}
```
