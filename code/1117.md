British astronomer Eddington liked to ride a bike. It is said that in order to show off his skill, he has even defined an "Eddington number", E -- that is, the maximum integer E such that it is for E days that one rides more than E miles. Eddington's own E was 87.

Now given everyday's distances that one rides for N days, you are supposed to find the corresponding E (<=N).

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N(<=105), the days of continuous riding. Then N non-negative integers are given in the next line, being the riding distances of everyday.

#### Output Specification:

For each case, print in a line the Eddington number for these N days.

#### Sample Input:
10
6 7 6 9 3 10 8 2 7 8
#### Sample Output:
6

**思路：**将读取的数据按降序排序后，题目可以转化为找到最大的满足a[i]>i+1的值。所以找到第一个满足a[i]<=i+1的值后，i就是要求的值。

```
#include<cstdio>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;
int a[100000];
int cmp(int a,int b){
    return a>b;
}
int main()
{
    int n,i;

    scanf("%d",&n);
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        scanf("%d",&a[i]);
    sort(a,a+n,cmp);
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        if(a[i]<=i+1) break;
    printf("%d\n",i);
    return 0;
}
```
