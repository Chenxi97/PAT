Given a non-negative integer N, your task is to compute the sum of all the digits of N, and output every digit of the sum in English.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies one line which contains an N (<= 10<sup>100</sup>).

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, output in one line the digits of the sum in English words. There must be one space between two consecutive words, but no extra space at the end of a line.

#### Sample Input:
12345
#### Sample Output:
one five

**题目要求：**将非负整数N的每一位相加，输出和中每一位数字对应的的英文单词。

**思路：**首先将每一位数字相加到sum中，将sum转换为字符串后，再将每一位按对应的单词输出。

```
#include<cstdio>
#include<cstring>
int main()
{
    int sum=0,i;
    char c,s[4],number[10][6]={"zero","one","two","three",
        "four","five","six","seven","eight","nine"};

    while((c=getchar())!='\n')
        sum+=(c-'0');
    sprintf(s,"%d",sum);
    int len=strlen(s);
    for(i=0;i<len-1;i++)
        printf("%s ",number[s[i]-'0']);
    printf("%s\n",number[s[i]-'0']);
    return 0;
}
```
