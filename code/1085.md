Given a sequence of positive integers and another positive integer p. The sequence is said to be a "perfect sequence" if M <= m * p where M and m are the maximum and minimum numbers in the sequence, respectively.

Now given a sequence and a parameter p, you are supposed to find from the sequence as many numbers as possible to form a perfect subsequence.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains two positive integers N and p, where N (<= 105) is the number of integers in the sequence, and p (<= 109) is the parameter. In the second line there are N positive integers, each is no greater than 109.

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the maximum number of integers that can be chosen to form a perfect subsequence.

#### Sample Input:
10 8
2 3 20 4 5 1 6 7 8 9
#### Sample Output:
8

**思路：**用二分查找第一个满足M <= m * p 的数，用ans记录个数的最大值。

```
#include<cstdio>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n,i,ans=0;
    long long p,a[100000];
    
    scanf("%d%lld",&n,&p);
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        scanf("%lld",&a[i]);
    sort(a,a+n);
    for(i=0;i+ans<n;i++){
        int mid,left=i,right=n;//右界为n
        while(left<right){
            mid=(left+right)/2;
            if(a[mid]>a[i]*p)
                right=mid;
            else
                left=mid+1;
        }
        ans=max(left-i,ans);
    }
    printf("%d\n",ans);
    return 0;
}
```
