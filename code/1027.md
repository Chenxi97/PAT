People in Mars represent the colors in their computers in a similar way as the Earth people. That is, a color is represented by a 6-digit number, where the first 2 digits are for Red, the middle 2 digits for Green, and the last 2 digits for Blue. The only difference is that they use radix 13 (0-9 and A-C) instead of 16. Now given a color in three decimal numbers (each between 0 and 168), you are supposed to output their Mars RGB values.

#### Input

Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line containing the three decimal color values.

#### Output

For each test case you should output the Mars RGB value in the following format: first output "#", then followed by a 6-digit number where all the English characters must be upper-cased. If a single color is only 1-digit long, you must print a "0" to the left.

#### Sample Input
15 43 71
#### Sample Output
#123456

**题目要求：**将三个10进制数转换为13进制

**思路：**由于转换为的13进制数只有两位，可以简单地记为n/13和n%13，在读取数据的同时进行进制转换。

```
#include<cstdio>
int main()
{
    int n,i;
    char a[14]="0123456789ABC";

    printf("#");
    for(i=0;i<3;i++){
        scanf("%d",&n);
        printf("%c%c",a[n/13],a[n%13]);  
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```
