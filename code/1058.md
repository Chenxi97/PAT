If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you would know the world of magic has its own currency system -- as Hagrid explained it to Harry, "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough." Your job is to write a program to compute A+B where A and B are given in the standard form of "Galleon.Sickle.Knut" (Galleon is an integer in [0, 107], Sickle is an integer in [0, 17), and Knut is an integer in [0, 29)).

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line with A and B in the standard form, separated by one space.

#### Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input.

#### Sample Input:
3.2.1 10.16.27
#### Sample Output:
14.1.28

**题目要求：**17个Sickle等于一个Galleon，29个Knut等于一个Sickle。把A和B按Galleon.Sickle.Knut的方式相加

**思路：**用int ans[3]保存结果。从低位开始加，超过范围的话取余，并向上一位进位。

```
#include<cstdio>
int main()
{
    int a[3],b[3],ans[3]={0},sco[3]={20000002,17,29},i;

    scanf("%d.%d.%d",&a[0],&a[1],&a[2]);
    scanf(" %d.%d.%d",&b[0],&b[1],&b[2]);
    for(i=2;i>=0;i--)
        if((ans[i]+=a[i]+b[i])>=sco[i]){
            ans[i-1]+=ans[i]/sco[i];
            ans[i]%=sco[i];
        }
    printf("%d.%d.%d\n",ans[0],ans[1],ans[2]);
    return 0;
}
```
