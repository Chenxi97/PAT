A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Insert a sequence of numbers into an initially empty binary search tree. Then you are supposed to count the total number of nodes in the lowest 2 levels of the resulting tree.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=1000) which is the size of the input sequence. Then given in the next line are the N integers in [-1000 1000] which are supposed to be inserted into an initially empty binary search tree.

#### Output Specification:

For each case, print in one line the numbers of nodes in the lowest 2 levels of the resulting tree in the format:

n1 + n2 = n

where n1 is the number of nodes in the lowest level, n2 is that of the level above, and n is the sum.

#### Sample Input:
9
25 30 42 16 20 20 35 -5 28
#### Sample Output:
2 + 4 = 6
