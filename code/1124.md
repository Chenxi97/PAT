John got a full mark on PAT. He was so happy that he decided to hold a raffle（抽奖） for his followers on Weibo -- that is, he would select winners from every N followers who forwarded his post, and give away gifts. Now you are supposed to help him generate the list of winners.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives three positive integers M (<= 1000), N and S, being the total number of forwards, the skip number of winners, and the index of the first winner (the indices start from 1). Then M lines follow, each gives the nickname (a nonempty string of no more than 20 characters, with no white space or return) of a follower who has forwarded John's post.

Note: it is possible that someone would forward more than once, but no one can win more than once. Hence if the current candidate of a winner has won before, we must skip him/her and consider the next one.

#### Output Specification:

For each case, print the list of winners in the same order as in the input, each nickname occupies a line. If there is no winner yet, print "Keep going..." instead.

#### Sample Input 1:
9 3 2
Imgonnawin!
PickMe

LookHere

TryAgainAgain

#### Sample Output 1:

#### Sample Input 2:
