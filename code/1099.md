A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Given the structure of a binary tree and a sequence of distinct integer keys, there is only one way to fill these keys into the tree so that the resulting tree satisfies the definition of a BST. You are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of that tree. The sample is illustrated by Figure 1 and 2.


#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=100) which is the total number of nodes in the tree. The next N lines each contains the left and the right children of a node in the format "left_index right_index", provided that the nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1, and 0 is always the root. If one child is missing, then -1 will represent the NULL child pointer. Finally N distinct integer keys are given in the last line.

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of that tree. All the numbers must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of the line.

#### Sample Input:
9
1 6
2 3
-1 -1
-1 4
5 -1
-1 -1
7 -1
-1 8
-1 -1
73 45 11 58 82 25 67 38 42
#### Sample Output:
58 25 82 11 38 67 45 73 42

**思路：**按照输入的顺序建树，然后中序遍历该树，把排好序的数据填入树中。

```
#include<cstdio>
#include<queue>
#include<algorithm>
#define MAX 101
using namespace std;
struct node{
    int data;
    int lchild,rchild;
}Node[MAX];
int n,a[MAX],index=0;
void inorder(int root){ //中序遍历
    if(root==-1) return;
    inorder(Node[root].lchild);
    Node[root].data=a[index++];
    inorder(Node[root].rchild);
}
int ct=0;
void level(int root){   //层序遍历
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(root);
    while(!q.empty()){
        int now=q.front();
        q.pop();
        printf("%d",Node[now].data);
        ct++;
        if(ct<n) printf(" ");
        if(Node[now].lchild!=-1) q.push(Node[now].lchild);
        if(Node[now].rchild!=-1) q.push(Node[now].rchild);
    }
}
int main()
{
    scanf("%d",&n);
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        scanf("%d%d",&Node[i].lchild,&Node[i].rchild);
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        scanf("%d",&a[i]);
    sort(a,a+n);
    inorder(0);
    level(0);
    return 0;
}
```
