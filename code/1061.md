Sherlock Holmes received a note with some strange strings: "Let's date! 3485djDkxh4hhGE 2984akDfkkkkggEdsb s&hgsfdk d&Hyscvnm". It took him only a minute to figure out that those strange strings are actually referring to the coded time "Thursday 14:04" -- since the first common capital English letter (case sensitive) shared by the first two strings is the 4th capital letter 'D', representing the 4th day in a week; the second common character is the 5th capital letter 'E', representing the 14th hour (hence the hours from 0 to 23 in a day are represented by the numbers from 0 to 9 and the capital letters from A to N, respectively); and the English letter shared by the last two strings is 's' at the 4th position, representing the 4th minute. Now given two pairs of strings, you are supposed to help Sherlock decode the dating time.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case gives 4 non-empty strings of no more than 60 characters without white space in 4 lines.

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, print the decoded time in one line, in the format "DAY HH:MM", where "DAY" is a 3-character abbreviation for the days in a week -- that is, "MON" for Monday, "TUE" for Tuesday, "WED" for Wednesday, "THU" for Thursday, "FRI" for Friday, "SAT" for Saturday, and "SUN" for Sunday. It is guaranteed that the result is unique for each case.

#### Sample Input:
3485djDkxh4hhGE 
2984akDfkkkkggEdsb 
s&hgsfdk 
d&Hyscvnm
#### Sample Output:
THU 14:04

**题目要求：**给出四行字符串1.前两行中第一个相同的大写字母（A~G），代表周一到周日。2.前两行中第二个相同的数字和大写字母（0~9，A~N），代表0~23点。3.后两行中第一个相同的字母的位置代表分钟。

**思路：**这道题题意有点奇怪。开始我一直在纳闷示例中的第三个数字8为什么没有被考虑，琢磨了好大一会儿才想明白，应该是在符合要求1的字符后面继续寻找符合要求2的。想明白这一点问题就不大了。使用ctype.h头文件中的isalpha()和isdigit()可以使条件语句更加简洁。

**易错点：**
1.时间要注意用"%02d"固定两位输出
2.求小时的时候字母和数字的处理方法要分开
```
#include<cstdio>
#include<cstring>
#include<ctype.h>
int main()
{
    char a[61],b[61],week[7][4]={"MON","TUE","WED",
        "THU","FRI","SAT","SUN"};
    int i,j;

    scanf(" %s %s",a,b);    //读取前两行，求星期
    for(i=0;i<61;i++)
        if(a[i]==b[i]&&a[i]>='A'&&a[i]<='G'){
            printf("%s ",week[a[i]-'A']);
            break;
        }
    for(j=i+1;j<61;j++){    //求小时
        if(a[j]!=b[j]) continue;
        if(a[j]>='A'&&a[j]<='N'){
            printf("%02d",a[j]-'A'+10);
            break;
        }
        if(isdigit(a[j])){
            printf("%02d",a[j]-'0');
            break;
        }
    }
    scanf(" %s %s,",a,b);   //读取后两行，求分钟
    for(i=0;i<61;i++)

            break;
