A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree where all the nodes on the same level belong to the same generation. Your task is to find the generation with the largest population.

#### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with two positive integers N (<100) which is the total number of family members in the tree (and hence assume that all the members are numbered from 01 to N), and M (<N) which is the number of family members who have children. Then M lines follow, each contains the information of a family member in the following format:

ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]

where ID is a two-digit number representing a family member, K (>0) is the number of his/her children, followed by a sequence of two-digit ID's of his/her children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be 01. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

#### Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the largest population number and the level of the corresponding generation. It is assumed that such a generation is unique, and the root level is defined to be 1.

#### Sample Input:
23 13
21 1 23
01 4 03 02 04 05
03 3 06 07 08
06 2 12 13
13 1 21
08 2 15 16
02 2 09 10
11 2 19 20
17 1 22
05 1 11
07 1 14
09 1 17
10 1 18
#### Sample Output:
9 4
